<h3> Our History</h3>
  <div class="container">
    
    <p> In the bustling city of Toronto, there stood a restaurant that had become the talk of the town.Established in 2020, "Happening" quickly became famous for its delectable North and South Indian tiffins and biryanis.Happening is not just a restaurant; it is an experience that transports diners to the heart of India with every bite.The restaurant's ambiance perfectly blends modern aesthetics and traditional charm. The walls, adorned with vibrant murals depicting scenes from Indian streets, set the stage for a gastronomic adventure.Breakfast at Happening is a delight, with steaming hot idlis and crispy dosas served alongside rich, aromatic filter coffee. For lunch, various biryanis like Hyderabadi Dum Biryani, the Lucknowi Chicken Biryani, and the aromatic Chettinad Lamb Biryani.As the years passed,  Happening continued to innovate, introducing new dishes while staying true to its roots.
